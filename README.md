# CNN_transferLearning
Transfer Learning Project collaborate with @erikajoun

This is a deep learning class project. We focus on training CNNs on different music datasets to predict genres and emotions.

For comparison, we used two state-of-the-arts (VGG-16 and ResNet) to train from the scratch and implement transfer learning as well.
